NeuralNets.jl
===============
Generic artificial neural networks in Julia

Things to do before we let other people know about this:
* get the validation set happening
* decent readme
* finish lmtrain.jl
* write an example that uses RDatabases
* set up package to work with the julia homebrew thing (Pkg.add("NeuralNets"))
